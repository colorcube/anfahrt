What does it do?
----------------

This is a TYPO3 plugin that provides a simple map with marker and popup window.

The editor has a comfortable way of placing the position of the location with address search (geo coding). Additionally
the position (marker) can be moved by drag and drop.

Google Maps is used as map provider.
